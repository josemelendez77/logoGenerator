# logoGenerator
# Description
I aimed to develop an application that prompts users with a series of questions. The user's responses would then be used to generate a custom SVG logo. This project aims to alleviate stress for busy entrepreneurs by streamlining the logo creation process. Throughout the development process, I gained insights into dynamic element placements, the significance of effective error handling, and the skill of identifying and utilizing external libraries.
